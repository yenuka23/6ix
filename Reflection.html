            <p>I started learning html 5 years ago. Back then i could make couple of pages and then link them togather. Last year i learned abot databses and making an API to connect to html. With this project i learned how to aling items and make cards in css and making effects such as hover. If i can improve for next time i would make desing plans first before i start writing the html and css. I would also try to have diffren css style sheets for each page so that each page is uniqe from the other. In this Website , i had to learn how to aling items and css to make it look proftional. For the navigation next time i will add back buttons that will go to the last page.I also learned Embedd and iframe but i ended up with embedd for the files.</p>
