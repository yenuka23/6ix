            I am a Grade 10 student at STEM Collegiate, born on August 29, 2009. I have a strong passion for technology and enjoy exploring robotics, Python programming, Arduino, and mechatronics. 
            I love working on STEM-related projects, whether it's coding, building circuits, or designing mechanical systems.Beyond my technical interests, I enjoy collaborating with others on projects, sharing ideas, and finding creative solutions to real-world problems. I also like learning about advancements in robotics, artificial intelligence, and automation, as these fields shape the future. Problem-solving and innovation excite me, and I'm always eager to learn more and improve my skills.In the future, I hope to expand my knowledge even further and possibly pursue a career in engineering, robotics, or another tech-related field.
